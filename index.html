                                    The programming language Better And Portable Code (BAPC) is a language for working with lists of integers.
                                    The language has two built-in functions: ‘R’ (reverse) and ‘D’ (drop).
                                    The function ‘R’ reverses its input list, and ’D’ drops the first element of its input and returns the rest,
                                     or gives an error in case its input is an empty list. To get more advanced behavior, functions can be composed: 
                                    “AB" is the function that first applies ‘A’ to its input and then ‘B’ to the resulting list. 
                                    For example, “RDD" is a function that reverses a list and then drops the first two elements.
                                    Unfortunately, our BAPC interpreter has bit rotted, so we ask you to write a new one.
                                     Given a BAPC program and its input, return its output or “error" in case ‘D’ is applied to an empty list.
                                      Lists are represented as the character ‘[’ followed by a comma-separated list of integers followed by the character ‘]’.
                                       Notice that the input and output lists can be quite long.

                                    You are given a sequence, in the form of a string with characters ‘0’, ‘1’, and ‘?’ only. 
                                    Suppose there are k ‘?’s. 
                                    Then there are 2k ways to replace each ‘?’ by a ‘0’ or a ‘1’, 
                                    giving 2k different 0-1 sequences (0-1 sequences are sequences with only zeroes and ones).

                                    For each 0-1 sequence, define its number of inversions as the minimum number of adjacent swaps 
                                    required to sort the sequence in non-decreasing order. In this problem, the sequence is sorted in non-decreasing 
                                    order precisely when all the zeroes occur before all the ones. For example, the sequence 11010 has 5 inversions.
                                    We can sort it by the following moves: 11010 → 11001 → 10101 → 01101 → 01011 → 00111.
                                    
                                    Find the sum of the number of inversions of the 2k sequences, modulo 1000000007 (109+7).
